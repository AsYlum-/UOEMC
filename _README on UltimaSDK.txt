UltimaSDK by default finds by self the UO installation dir.
In order to (quickly) make possible to select a custom dir containing map and statics files,
i made some horrible changes to UltimaSDK, just to make it work as i want.

I also made changes in order to support the bigger item IDs, which came with SA
bigger art.mul and tiledata.mul. Maybe you are interested into this: can't remember now
what i did, but in changed the ID variable type from an int/long to an unsigned int/long.

In this project you will find only the files of UltimaSDK that served EMC purpose.
